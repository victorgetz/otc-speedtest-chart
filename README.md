  a [mutating webhook](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/bank-vaults/mutating-webhook/) rather than be part of your chart

* Use subcharts to manage dependencies whenever possible
* **Document** every values.yaml variable that is meant to be adjusted

* Add /charts/ to .gitignore
* Provide a default .helmignore
